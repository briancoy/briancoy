## 🚀 Featured Projects

### ♟️ Chess Fair-Play & Anomaly Detection
*Architecting large-scale ETL and fraud detection frameworks.*
* **Objective:** Identify cheating patterns in online chess using move-level sequential analysis.
* **Tech:** Python, SQLite, Scikit-learn, Pandas.
* **Impact:** Processed **12.2 million records** and evaluated **One-Class SVM** and **Random Forest** models to prove that aggregate metrics (Accuracy vs. ELO) are insufficient for fraud detection.

### 📊 Bayesian Hierarchical Modeling
*Statistical inference on US maternal health disparities.*
* **Objective:** Explore drivers of preterm birth disparities among Medicaid-covered births (2020-2022).
* **Tech:** Python, **PyMC**, Bayesian GLM.
* **Impact:** Developed hierarchical regression models to communicate complex health drivers visually for non-technical stakeholders.
